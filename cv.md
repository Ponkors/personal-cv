### Briefly About Myself:
Hi, **my name is *Vlad***. Now I am a second year student at the *Faculty of Physics and Mathematics* in the Brest State A. S. Pushkin University. I study physics and computer science. **My goal** is to create products that can understand humans an intuitive level and be understandable to users. Maybe I'm a madman. Confident that I can change the world. Motivated by the story of *Steve Jobs* and *Pavel Durov*.
> The ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. - *Steve Jobs.*

##### I will be glad to cooperate with your company ;)

### About my experience in Python Development
So, first of all I'm a *beginner* in this sphere of development. I'm learning Python on the popular platform, it's called **[Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/profile/9581052)** and **[w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)**. I had a little experience in the development, I wrote a simple *python* calculator with a primitive interface.  I'm used a GUI, which called «TKinter», it's look like as Delphi from 2007 year. That's explain why my calculator look so strange. In plans, I want to write this calculator on a new GUI(Integrated with JS, it's make it more beautiful) and add new features. **In my idea:** make the calculator for Windows OS which will be look like as calculator from macOS(Apple). Other people said to me that this is a bad idea, making the calculator with collaboration with JS and Python. Now I'm looking for new possibilities and people, with which we can develop our skills, also in programming.
Interesting in Python Development, FrontEnd, BackEnd and create new products.
