### Briefly About Myself:
Hi, **my name is *Vlad***. Now I am a second year student at the *Faculty of Physics and Mathematics* in the Brest State A. S.

Motivated by the story of *Steve Jobs* and *Pavel Durov*.
> The ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. - *Steve Jobs.*
